TEST-001,Cardiology Consultation for Palpitations,Outpatient Cardiology Clinic,Cardiology,"Doctor: ""Mr. Thompson, your primary care doctor referred you for heart palpitations. Tell me about them.""
Patient: ""For the past two months, I get these episodes where my heart suddenly races. It feels like it's going to jump out of my chest."" 
Doctor: ""How long do they last?"" 
Patient: ""Usually 5 to 10 minutes, then they stop suddenly."" 
Doctor: ""How often?"" 
Patient: ""Maybe twice a week. Sometimes when I'm exercising, sometimes just sitting."" 
Doctor: ""Any chest pain, dizziness, or fainting?"" 
Patient: ""I feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I've never passed out."" 
Doctor: ""Are you taking any medications?"" 
Patient: ""Just losartan for blood pressure, 50mg daily."" 
Doctor: ""Any caffeine, alcohol, drugs?"" 
Patient: ""Two cups of coffee in the morning, glass of wine with dinner most nights."" 
Doctor: ""Family history of heart problems?"" 
Patient: ""My mother has atrial fibrillation."" 
Doctor: ""Your EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm. Your echo from last month showed normal ejection fraction of 60%, no structural abnormalities. Based on your symptoms - sudden onset and offset, brief duration - this sounds like paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. I'm ordering a 30-day event monitor to capture these episodes. Meanwhile, try vagal maneuvers when they occur - bearing down or coughing forcefully. If we confirm PSVT, we can discuss beta blockers or ablation. Reduce caffeine to one cup daily.""","Ms. Smith, age not specified and with no chronic illnesses mentioned, presents with progressive left knee pain and swelling. She reports that the pain has been present for a while and is exacerbated by physical activity such as exercise, long walks, climbing stairs, and walking her dog. Recently, the pain has intensified, with increased swelling, clicking, and sharp pains, particularly after straightening the knee. The discomfort is now severe enough to disrupt her sleep. She denies any history of trauma or injury to the knee. The pain is localized to the anterior aspect of the knee and is described as equally affecting both sides.

1. M25.569 (Pain in unspecified knee)
- Recommend obtaining knee X-rays to evaluate for structural abnormalities or degenerative changes.
- Consider MRI if X-rays are inconclusive and symptoms persist.
- Advise rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol) for symptom management.
- Recommend NSAIDs for pain control if no contraindications.
- Assess for possible physical therapy referral if pain persists or functional limitation continues.
- Monitor for signs of infection (increased redness, warmth, fever).
- Counsel on activity modification to avoid exacerbating movements.
- Age-appropriate screening: If over 50, recommend annual blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screening per USPSTF guidelines.This visit is a NPT 3. The complexity is moderate due to the new onset of significant knee pain and swelling without clear etiology, requiring further diagnostic evaluation and management.

Number and Complexity of Problems Addressed: One new musculoskeletal complaint (left knee pain and swelling) with moderate complexity due to the need for imaging and possible further workup.
Data Reviewed and Analyzed: No diagnostic tests reviewed at this visit; imaging is recommended.
Risk of Complications, Morbidity, or Mortality: Moderate, as the pain is interfering with sleep and daily activities, and further workup is needed to rule out serious pathology.
