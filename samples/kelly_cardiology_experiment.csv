He reports experiencing episodes of his heart suddenly racing over the past two months. These episodes typically last five to ten minutes and occur approximately twice a week. The palpitations sometimes happen during exercise, but they can also occur while he is at rest. During these episodes, Donald feels as though his heart is jumping out of his chest and experiences mild light-headedness. He denies any associated chest pain, dizziness, or fainting. Past Medical History - Donald is currently taking Slow Certain 50 milligrams daily for blood pressure. He drinks two cups of coffee in the morning and a glass of wine with dinner most nights. His family history is significant for his mother having atrial fibrillation. There is no mention of allergies, previous surgeries, or other chronic conditions apart from hypertension. Physical Examination - General: Appears well and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm noted on today's EKG. No structural abnormalities noted on echocardiogram from last month, with normal ejection fraction of 60%. Investigations - The EKG performed today showed normal sinus rhythm. Donald underwent an echocardiogram last month, which revealed a normal ejection fraction of 60% and no structural abnormalities. To further investigate his symptoms, a 30-day event monitor has been ordered to capture additional data during episodes. Impression (Assessment & Diagnosis) - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), suspected based on: Sudden onset and offset of symptoms, Short duration of episodes (five to ten minutes), Patient-reported symptoms including palpitations and light-headedness, Family history of atrial fibrillation. Management Plan - A 30-day event monitor has been ordered to capture and evaluate the heart rhythm during symptomatic episodes. Donald was advised to try vagal maneuvers, such as bearing down or forcefully coughing, when these episodes occur. He was also instructed to reduce his caffeine intake to one cup per day. Based on confirmation of PSVT, further interventions such as beta-blockers or ablation may be discussed as needed.

He reports experiencing episodes of his heart suddenly racing over the past two months. These episodes typically last five to ten minutes and occur approximately twice a week. The palpitations sometimes happen during exercise, but they can also occur while he is at rest. During these episodes, Donald feels as though his heart is jumping out of his chest and experiences mild light-headedness. He denies any associated chest pain, dizziness, or fainting. Past Medical History - Donald is currently taking Slow Certain 50 milligrams daily for blood pressure. He drinks two cups of coffee in the morning and a glass of wine with dinner most nights. His family history is significant for his mother having atrial fibrillation. There is no mention of allergies, previous surgeries, or other chronic conditions apart from hypertension. Physical Examination - General: Appears well and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm noted on today's EKG. No structural abnormalities noted on echocardiogram from last month, with normal ejection fraction of 60%. Investigations - The EKG performed today showed normal sinus rhythm. Donald underwent an echocardiogram last month, which revealed a normal ejection fraction of 60% and no structural abnormalities. To further investigate his symptoms, a 30-day event monitor has been ordered to capture additional data during episodes. Impression (Assessment & Diagnosis) - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), suspected based on: Sudden onset and offset of symptoms, Short duration of episodes (five to ten minutes), Patient-reported symptoms including palpitations and light-headedness, Family history of atrial fibrillation. Management Plan - A 30-day event monitor has been ordered to capture and evaluate the heart rhythm during symptomatic episodes. Donald was advised to try vagal maneuvers, such as bearing down or forcefully coughing, when these episodes occur. He was also instructed to reduce his caffeine intake to one cup per day. Based on confirmation of PSVT, further interventions such as beta-blockers or ablation may be discussed as needed. A follow-up plan will be established after results from the event monitor are reviewed.","Low","Treatment plan documentation","healthcare","scribe_documentation","conversational","Standard","authenticated_provider"
